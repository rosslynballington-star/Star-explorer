        <h2>welcome space explorer</h2>
        <p>did you know constellations tell ancient stories?</p>
        <h2>Stars</h2>
        
        <p>colossal spheres of hot, glowing gas—primarily hydrogen and helium—that generate energy through nuclear fusion in their cores, producing light and heat</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Composition: Stars are mostly hydrogen and helium, though they also contain trace amounts of other elements.</p>
        <p>Plasma: The immense heat and energy inside a star strip atoms of their electrons, creating a state of matter called plasma.</p>
        <p>Gravity: A star's own gravity holds its massive form together.</p>
        <h2>Energy Generation</h2>
        <p>Nuclear Fusion: At the core of a star, intense pressure and temperature cause hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy as light and heat.</p>
        <h2>Stellar Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>Formation: Stars form from dense regions within large clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae, which collapse under their own gravity.</p>
        <p>Main Sequence: Once nuclear fusion begins, a star enters its stable, main-sequence phase, burning hydrogen in its core. </p>
        <p>Evolution and Death: As a star ages, it exhausts its hydrogen fuel. Low-mass stars, like our Sun, will eventually become red giants and then die as white dwarfs. More massive stars, however, explode in a supernova, scattering their material to form new stars and planets.</p>
        <h2>Visibility and Scale</h2>
        <p>Galactic Building Blocks: Stars are the fundamental components of galaxies, with the Milky Way alone containing billions of stars.</p>
        <p>Immense Distance: Although some stars are visible to the naked eye, their enormous distances from Earth make them appear as tiny points of light.</p>
